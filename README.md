# 🏠 HomeCluster Repository

Welcome to the **HomeCluster** repository! 🎉 This repo contains all the Kubernetes object definitions for managing my home cluster. It's designed to be a single source of truth, leveraging **ArgoCD** for GitOps-style synchronization. 🚀

---

## 📚 **Overview**

This repository is structured to manage both **applications** and **infrastructure components** in my home Kubernetes cluster. Using ArgoCD, the cluster stays in sync with this repo, ensuring a declarative and automated deployment process. 🛠️

### ✨ Features
- **GitOps with ArgoCD**: Automated syncing of cluster resources from this repository. 🔄
- **Declarative Configurations**: YAML manifests for all applications and infrastructure components. 📜
- **Namespace Isolation**: Applications are neatly organized into namespaces for better management. 🗂️
- **Self-Healing Deployments**: ArgoCD ensures that any drift from the desired state is corrected automatically. ❤️‍🩹

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/orazefabian/homecluster.git
cd homecluster
```

### 2️⃣ Install ArgoCD:
Follow the [official ArgoCD installation guide](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/).

### 3️⃣ Apply the ArgoCD ApplicationSet:
```bash
kubectl apply -f argocd.yaml
```

### 4️⃣ Watch the Magic! ✨
ArgoCD will automatically sync the resources defined in this repository to your cluster.

## ⚙️ **ArgoCD Sync Policy**

The sync policy is configured as follows:
- **Automated Sync**: Resources are automatically applied to the cluster.
- **Self-Healing**: Any drift from the desired state is corrected.
- **Namespace Creation**: Namespaces are created automatically if they don't exist.

---

## 📊 Status Monitoring

Use the ArgoCD UI to monitor application health and sync status:
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
```
Access the UI at [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080). 🎨
